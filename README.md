Brackets Extension to Display Shortcuts in bottom panel

## Overview

This is an Extension for [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets). 

## Features

This extension is accessed in Brackets using menu `View > Show Shortcuts` or with the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-Alt-/` on Windows and `Control-Shift-/` on Mac.

This extension displays all shortcuts defined for:
* Brackets
* CodeMirror (which not overridden by Brackets)
* Extensions which are currently installed 

All columns are sortable in both ascending and descending order.

Display of "Extension" in Origin column is dependent on command using proper naming convention.
