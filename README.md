Brackets Extension to Display Shortcuts in bottom panel

## Overview

This is an Extension for [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets). 

## Features

This extension is accessed in Brackets using menu `View > Show Shortcuts` or with the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-Shift-/` on Window and `Control-Shift-/` on Mac.

This extension displays all shortcuts defined for:
* Brackets
* CodeMirror (which not overridden by Brackets)
* Extensions which are currently installed 

All columns are sortable in both ascending and descending order.

Display of "Extension" in Origin column is dependent on command using proper naming convention.

Button to "Copy to Current Document" inserts Table HTML markup at the current selection. It only works for full editor.
